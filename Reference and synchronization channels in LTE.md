>[!important] control signalling

### Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)
- DL
- info about phy layer for UEs initial access or handover

### Primary synchronization signal
-  sync signals used to distinguish cells
- distinguishes 3 cell identities

### Secondary sycndhronization signal
- also used to distinguish cells
- defines 168 phy layer cell id groups

### Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
- scheduling info for indiv users
- first symbol in each DL subframe

### Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
- UL control info
- ACK or NACK, channel quality info, shceduling requests

**various reference signal (called pilots) for channel estimation**
