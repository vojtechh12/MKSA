D2D brings various benefits such as:
- high bitrates
- spectral efficiency (esp. in shared D2D)
- lower delay
- saving radio resources (DUEs do not bother eNB in shared D2D)

**3 main modes**

### 1. Cellular mode
- basically not D2D
- or I don't see the point

### 2. Dedicated mode
- DUE and CUE use orthogonal resources

### 3. Shared mode
- CUE and DUE use the same resources
- can lead to higher bitrates in case of lower interference between CUE and DUE
