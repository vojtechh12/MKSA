- High PAPR as main problem in OFDM is problematic in UL, therefore OFMA is used only in DL
- *The main reason for exploitation of SC-FDMA in uplink communication is high energy consumption of OFDMA, which is caused by high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). ==The SC-FDMA adds, on top of OFDMA, blocks of DFT and mapping of subcarrier frequencies==. This modification leads to spread of transmitted symbols over all subcarriers which reduces PAPR.*
